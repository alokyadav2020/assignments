    "In object-oriented programming (OOP), a class is a blueprint for creating objects (instances) with certain properties (attributes) and behaviors (methods). It serves as a template or a model for creating objects. An object, on the other hand, is an instance of a class. It is a concrete realization of the class blueprint, possessing its own unique state and behavior.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's a breakdown of each concept:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Class**:\n",
    "   - A class is a user-defined data type in OOP.\n",
    "   - It defines a blueprint or a template for creating objects.\n",
    "   - It encapsulates data (attributes) and methods (functions) that operate on that data.\n",
    "   - It defines the structure and behavior of objects that belong to it.\n",
    "   - Classes promote code reusability and maintainability by providing a way to organize related functionality.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Object**:\n",
    "   - An object is an instance of a class.\n",
    "   - It represents a specific entity of the class.\n",
    "   - Each object has its own unique identity, state, and behavior.\n",
    "   - Objects are created based on the class blueprint, and they can access the attributes and methods defined in the class.\n",
    "   - Multiple objects can be created from the same class, each with its own independent state.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's consider a simple example of a `Car` class:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class Car:\n",
    "    def __init__(self, make, model, year):\n",
    "        self.make = make\n",
    "        self.model = model\n",
    "        self.year = year\n",
    "        self.odometer_reading = 0  # Default value for odometer reading\n",
    "\n",
    "    def get_description(self):\n",
    "        return f\"{self.year} {self.make} {self.model}\"\n",
    "\n",
    "    def read_odometer(self):\n",
    "        return f\"This car has {self.odometer_reading} miles on it.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "    def update_odometer(self, mileage):\n",
    "        if mileage >= self.odometer_reading:\n",
    "            self.odometer_reading = mileage\n",
    "        else:\n",
    "            print(\"You can't roll back an odometer!\")\n",
    "\n",
    "    def increment_odometer(self, miles):\n",
    "        self.odometer_reading += miles\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `Car` is a class that represents the blueprint for creating car objects.\n",
    "- Attributes such as `make`, `model`, `year`, and `odometer_reading` represent the state of each car object.\n",
    "- Methods like `get_description()`, `read_odometer()`, `update_odometer()`, and `increment_odometer()` represent the behavior of car objects.\n",
    "- An object of the `Car` class can be created to represent a specific car instance, each with its own make, model, and year.\n",
    "- For example, we can create car objects like:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "my_car = Car(\"Toyota\", \"Camry\", 2022)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, `my_car` is an object of the `Car` class, representing a Toyota Camry of the year 2022. This object has its own unique state (make, model, year) and behavior (methods)."

   "source": [
    "The four pillars of object-oriented programming (OOP) are:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Encapsulation**: Encapsulation refers to the bundling of data (attributes) and methods (functions) that operate on that data into a single unit, known as a class. It hides the internal state of an object from the outside world and only exposes the necessary functionality through well-defined interfaces. Encapsulation helps in achieving data abstraction and information hiding, which enhances code maintainability and security.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Abstraction**: Abstraction is the process of simplifying complex systems by modeling only the relevant aspects and ignoring unnecessary details. In OOP, abstraction is achieved through classes and objects. It allows programmers to focus on the essential characteristics of an object while hiding the implementation details. Abstraction helps in managing complexity, improving code readability, and facilitating code reuse.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Inheritance**: Inheritance is a mechanism by which a class can inherit properties and behavior from another class, called the base class or superclass. The class that inherits from the superclass is known as the derived class or subclass. Inheritance promotes code reuse and enables the creation of hierarchical relationships between classes. Subclasses can extend the functionality of their superclass by adding new methods or overriding existing ones. This facilitates the creation of specialized classes and promotes modularity and extensibility in software design.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Polymorphism**: Polymorphism refers to the ability of objects to take on multiple forms or to behave differently in different contexts. In OOP, polymorphism is achieved through method overriding and method overloading. Method overriding allows a subclass to provide a specific implementation of a method that is already defined in its superclass. Method overloading enables the definition of multiple methods with the same name but different parameter lists within a class. Polymorphism promotes flexibility, modularity, and code reusability by allowing objects to be treated uniformly regardless of their specific types."

    "The `__init__()` function is a special method in Python that is automatically called when a new instance of a class is created. It stands for \"initialize\" and is commonly used to initialize the attributes of an object with initial values. \n",
    "\n",
    "Here's why the `__init__()` function is used:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Initialization**: The primary purpose of the `__init__()` method is to initialize the state of newly created objects. It allows you to set initial values for attributes and perform any necessary setup or initialization tasks when an object is instantiated.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Attribute Assignment**: Inside the `__init__()` method, you can assign values to the attributes of the object using the `self` keyword. This ensures that each instance of the class has its own independent state.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Customization**: The `__init__()` method provides an opportunity to customize the initialization process for objects of a class. You can define parameters for the `__init__()` method to accept arguments during object creation and use those arguments to initialize object attributes.\n",

    "In object-oriented programming (OOP), `self` is a reference to the current instance of a class. It is used within methods to access and modify attributes or call other methods of the same object.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are the main reasons why `self` is used in OOP:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Accessing Instance Variables**: Inside a class method, `self` is used to access the instance variables (attributes) of the current object. This allows each instance of the class to have its own independent state.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Calling Other Methods**: `self` is used to call other methods of the same object from within a method. This allows methods to interact with each other and share data within the object.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Passing the Object Itself**: When a method is called on an object, Python automatically passes the object itself as the first argument to the method. By convention, this argument is named `self`, although you can choose any name you like. This allows methods to operate on the specific instance of the class to which they belong.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Maintaining Object Scope**: Using `self` ensures that methods and attributes are properly scoped within the object. It distinguishes between instance variables and local variables within a method, preventing naming conflicts.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Clarity and Readability**: The use of `self` makes the code more readable and understandable. It explicitly indicates that a method or attribute belongs to the object itself, improving code clarity and maintainability.\n",

    "Here's a simple example to illustrate the use of `self` in OOP:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class MyClass:\n",
    "    def __init__(self, value):\n",
    "        self.value = value\n",
    "\n",
    "    def print_value(self):\n",
    "        print(self.value)\n",

    "obj.double_value()\n",
    "obj.print_value()   # Output: 10\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `self.value` refers to the `value` attribute of the current instance of `MyClass`.\n",
    "- `self` is used to call the `print_value()` and `double_value()` methods on the `obj` object, allowing them to operate on the object's state."
